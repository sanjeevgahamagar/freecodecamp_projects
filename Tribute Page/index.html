            <p>Martin Luther was one of the most important religious thinkers of his millennium. The split of Western Christianity into Protestants and Catholics happened partly because of his writings and teachings. He also popularized the notion that the Bible should be published in the language that everyday people spoke. Before Luther, the commonly used Latin Bible had to be translated by the priests for ordinary people. In addition, Luther believed that priests, monks, and ministers should be allowed to marry. This contradicted Christian teachings of that time. To Luther, the Bible should be the only source of spiritual authority. He opposed giving spiritual authority to tradition, the pope, or any other political or religious leader, including himself. </p>

             <p>The Ninety-five Theses (1517)
A thesis is an argument or statement. Luther wrote these theses after another religious leader was reported to have preached that if people made payments to the church, then God would forgive their sins. This practice was known as the selling of indulgences. In the Ninety-five Theses Luther objected to the selling of indulgences. He also suggested that because the pope was rich, perhaps he should not collect money from poor people. In previous centuries Lutherâ€™s writings might never have become widely available. However, the invention of the printing press meant that books and ideas traveled further. Printed copies of the Ninety-five Theses began to circulate. Protestants considered publication of the Ninety-five Theses to be the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. This was a religious revolution in which Western Christianity split into Roman Catholics and Protestants. (The Eastern and Western branches of Christianity had already split in 1054.)
